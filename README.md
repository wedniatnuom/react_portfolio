# React Portfolio

## Description

- Project Motivation: I needed a page to make accessing the work that I have done simple. I'm hoping that with further work on this page I will have something that I can be confident in when speaking with potential employers.

- Purpose: We were tasked to use React to build a single page web document where we can intorduce ourselves to others in the industry.

- What did it solve: It gives me a place to find my best work without having to dig through all of my repositories on GitHub.

- What I learned along the way: I learned the basics of React, specifically though, I gained a better understanding of how props work.

## Installation

Steps required to get off the ground: The app will be running live on GitHub.

## Future Developement

The app is in it's most basic form currently. I plan on making it better through styling, as well as adding more information. This is the minimum viable product for this assignment.
